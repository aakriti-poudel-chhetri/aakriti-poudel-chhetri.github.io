Hi! I am Aakriti. I am an Environmental Professional advancing toward a specialization in data science. My work focuses on the connection between environmental sustainability and communication, and research aimed at reducing our environmental footprint. When I am not working, I enjoy cooking, reading fictional books and hiking. I love dogs and horses.
