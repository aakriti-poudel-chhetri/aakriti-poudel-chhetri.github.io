    "text": "About data\nThe data for this study were retrieved from multiple sources listed below.\nNight lights - The NASA’s Worldview is explored for extracting the data around the day of the storm. There are several days with too much cloud cover to be useful, but 2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16 provides two clear, contrasting images to visualize the extent of the power outage in Texas.\nVIIRS data is distributed through NASA’s Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC). Many NASA Earth data products are distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. Tiles are identified by their horizontal and vertical position in the grid. Houston lies on the border of tiles h08v05 and h08v06. These two tiles per date were pre-downloaded and provided by the team.\nRoads - We used Geofabrik’s download sites to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas and prepared a Geopackage (.gpkg file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area.\nHouses - The data were downloaded from Geofabrik and processed to create a GeoPackage containing only residential buildings within the Houston metropolitan area.\nSocioeconomic - The socioecoomic data were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for census tracts in 2019.\nLet’s read the datsets.\n\n\nCode\n# Read night lights data\ntile05_07 &lt;- read_stars(here::here('posts', '2025-12-impacts-of-extreme-weather', 'data', 'VNP46A1', 'VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif'))\ntile06_07 &lt;- read_stars(here::here('posts', '2025-12-impacts-of-extreme-weather', 'data', 'VNP46A1', 'VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif'))\ntile05_16 &lt;- read_stars(here::here('posts', '2025-12-impacts-of-extreme-weather','data', 'VNP46A1', 'VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif'))\ntile06_16 &lt;- read_stars(here::here('posts', '2025-12-impacts-of-extreme-weather', 'data', 'VNP46A1', 'VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif'))\n\n\n# Read roads data\nhighways &lt;- st_read(here::here('posts', '2025-12-impacts-of-extreme-weather', 'data', 'gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg'),\n                 query = \"SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass = 'motorway'\") %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 'EPSG:3083')\n\n\n# Read houses data\nhouses &lt;- st_read(here::here('posts', '2025-12-impacts-of-extreme-weather', 'data',\n                          'gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg'),\n  query = \"SELECT *\n    FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1\n    WHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL)\n      OR type IN ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')\") %&gt;% \n    st_transform('EPSG:3083')\n\n\n# Explore the contents of the geodatabase\nsocioeconomic &lt;- st_layers(here::here('posts', '2025-12-impacts-of-extreme-weather', 'data', 'ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb'))\n\n# Extract the census tract information\ncensus_tract &lt;- st_read(here::here('posts', '2025-12-impacts-of-extreme-weather', 'data', 'ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb'), layer = 'ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS') %&gt;% \n  st_transform('EPSG:3083')\n\n# Extract the income information\nincome &lt;- st_read(here::here('posts', '2025-12-impacts-of-extreme-weather', 'data', 'ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb'), layer = 'X19_INCOME')\n\n\nFirst, the raster tiles were merged and cropped to the Houston bounding box to focus the analysis on the study area and ensure that only valid night-light data within Houston were used for assessing power outages.\n\n\nCode\n# Merge two raster data of February 7\nnightlight_07 &lt;- st_mosaic(tile05_07, tile06_07)\n\n# Merge two raster data of February 16\nnightlight_16 &lt;- st_mosaic(tile05_16, tile06_16)\n\n# Create Houston bounding box\nhouston_bbox &lt;- st_bbox(c(xmin = -96.5, xmax = -94.5, ymin = 29, ymax = 30.5),\n                        crs = 'EPSG:4326')\n\n# Crop all raster data to Houston area\nnightlight_07_crop &lt;- st_crop(nightlight_07, houston_bbox)\nnightlight_07_crop[(nightlight_07_crop &gt; 1000) | (nightlight_07_crop &lt;= 0)] &lt;- NA\n\nnightlight_16_crop &lt;- st_crop(nightlight_16, houston_bbox)\nnightlight_16_crop[(nightlight_16_crop &gt; 1000) | (nightlight_16_crop &lt;= 0)] &lt;- NA\n\n\nHere, we visualize the comparison between night-light intensities in Houston before and after the February 2021 winter storm. By mapping the February 7 (pre-storm) and February 16 (post-storm) night-light data side by side, the analysis shows areas where lighting and likely power availability changed, helping to identify regions affected by the blackout.\n\n\nCode\n# Map for February 7 (before storm)\nbeforestorm &lt;- tm_shape(nightlight_07_crop) +\n  tm_raster(col.scale = tm_scale_continuous(values = 'inferno'),\n            col.legend = tm_legend(title = 'Night light\\nintensity',\n                                   position = tm_pos_out('right'))) +\n  tm_title('Houston Night Lights\\nFebruary 07, 2021 (Before storm)',\n           size = 1.3) +\n  tm_compass(position = c('left', 'top'),\n             type = 'arrow',\n             size = 3,\n             text.size = 0.6,\n             color.dark = 'grey50',\n             text.color = 'white') +  \n  tm_scalebar(position = c('right', 'bottom'),\n              text.size = 0.8,\n              color.dark = 'grey50',\n              text.color = 'white') +  \n  tm_layout(bg.color = 'white',           \n            outer.bg.color = 'white',      \n            frame = FALSE,\n            legend.show = FALSE)\n\n\n# Map for February 16 (after storm)\nafterstorm &lt;- tm_shape(nightlight_16_crop) +\n  tm_raster(col.scale = tm_scale_continuous(values = 'inferno'),\n            col.legend = tm_legend(title = 'Night light\\nintensity',\n                                   position = tm_pos_out('right'))) +\n  tm_title('Houston Night Lights\\nFebruary 16, 2021 (After storm)',\n           size = 1.3) +\n  tm_compass(position = c('left', 'top'),\n             type = 'arrow',\n             size = 3,\n             text.size = 0.6,\n             color.dark = 'grey50',\n             text.color = 'white') +  \n  tm_scalebar(position = c('right', 'bottom'),\n              text.size = 0.8,\n              color.dark = 'grey50',\n              text.color = 'white') +  \n  tm_layout(frame = FALSE,\n            legend.show = FALSE)\n\nlegend_map &lt;- tm_shape(nightlight_16_crop) +\n  tm_raster(col.scale = tm_scale_continuous(values = 'inferno'),\n            col.legend = tm_legend(title = 'Night light\\nintensity',\n                                   position = tm_pos_out('right'))) +\n  tm_layout(legend.only = TRUE, legend.outside = TRUE, legend.position = c(\"right\", \"center\"))\n\ntmap_arrange(beforestorm, afterstorm, legend_map, ncol = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will now create a blackout mask by identifying areas of Houston where night light intensity decreased significantly after the storm, indicating potential power outages. By calculating the difference between before and after night light, cropping to the study area, filtering out minor changes, and vectorizing the result, the mask provides a spatial representation of blackout affected regions for further analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate the difference in light intensity\nnightlight_diff &lt;- nightlight_07 - nightlight_16\n\n# Crop and reclassify the raster data \nmask &lt;- st_crop(nightlight_diff, houston_bbox)\nmask[mask &lt; 200] &lt;- NA\n\n# Vectorize the blackout mask\nblackout &lt;- st_as_sf(mask,\n                     as_points = FALSE,\n                     merge = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  st_make_valid() %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 'EPSG:3083')\n\n\nIn this step, highway geometries are combined and buffered to exclude areas where changes in night light intensity could be due to traffic rather than power outages. By removing blackout areas within 200 meters of highways, the analysis isolates regions where lighting loss more likely reflects true residential or commercial power outages.\n\n\nCode\n# Combine all highway geometries into one\nhighways_union &lt;- st_union(highways)\n\n# Create 200m buffer around all highways\nhighways_buffer &lt;- st_buffer(highways_union, dist = 200)\n\n# Find areas that experienced blackouts further than 200m from highways\nblackout_far &lt;- st_difference(blackout, highways_buffer)\n\n# Visualize the blackout in Houston\ntm_basemap('OpenStreetMap') +\n  tm_shape(blackout_far) +\n    tm_polygons(fill = 'ivory', fill_alpha = 0.8, col = 'black') +\n    tm_title('Blackout areas in Houston', fontface = 'bold', size = 1) +\n    tm_layout(legend.show = TRUE) +\n    tm_scalebar(position = c('left', 'bottom')) +\n    tm_compass(position = c('right', 'top'))\n\n\nNow estimate the number of homes in Houston that lost power during the February 2021 winter storms. By identifying which building footprints intersect with the blackout mask, the analysis isolates the homes likely affected by outages. Converting buildings to centroids allows for precise spatial calculations and comparisons between impacted and non-impacted houses, resulting in an estimated total of approximately 157,970 homes without power.\n\n\nCode\n# Keep buildings that intersect with blackout areas\nhouses_blackout &lt;- st_intersects(houses, blackout_far)\n\n# Check if each building is in a blackout area\nin_blackout &lt;- lengths(houses_blackout) &gt; 0\n\n# Filter buildings in blackout areas\nblackout_houses &lt;- houses[in_blackout, ]\n\n# Number of impacted buildings\nn_blackout_houses &lt;- nrow(blackout_houses)\n\n# Convert all buildings to centroids\nhouses_points &lt;- houses %&gt;% \n  st_centroid()\n\n# Houses impacted by blackouts\nhouses_impacted &lt;- blackout_houses %&gt;% \n  st_centroid()\n\n# Houses not impacted by blackouts\nhouses_not_impacted &lt;- houses_points %&gt;% \n  filter(!osm_id %in% blackout_houses$osm_id)\n\n\nThis map visualizes the spatial distribution of homes in Houston that lost power during the February 2021 winter storms. Impacted houses are highlighted in red, while unaffected houses are shown in blue, allowing for a clear comparison of affected versus unaffected areas across the city. The map provides a detailed spatial perspective on the extent of the blackout and helps identify which neighborhoods were most impacted.\n\n\nCode\n# Create the map\ntm_basemap('OpenStreetMap') +\n  tm_shape(houses_not_impacted) +\n    tm_dots(fill = 'midnightblue', size = 0.02, fill_alpha = 0.8) +\n  tm_shape(houses_impacted) +\n    tm_dots(fill = 'firebrick', size = 0.02, fill_alpha = 0.8) + \n  tm_title('Houses in Houston that lost power',\n           position = tm_pos_out('center', 'top'), \n           fontface = 'bold', size = 1.2) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,\n            legend.outside.position = 'right',\n            legend.title.size = 1,\n            legend.text.size = 0.8) +\n  tm_add_legend(labels = c('Impacted houses', 'Not impacted houses'),\n                fill = c('firebrick', 'midnightblue'),\n                col = c('firebrick', 'midnightblue'),\n                alpha = c(0.2, 0.7, 0.5),\n                title = 'Legend') +\n  tm_scalebar(position = c('left', 'bottom'),\n              text.size = 0.6) +\n  tm_compass(position = c('right', 'bottom'),\n             type = '4star',\n             size = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following process links census tract boundaries with median household income data to analyze the socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods affected by the blackout. By joining the income dataset to the census tract geometries, the analysis enables comparisons between impacted and non-impacted areas and supports investigation of whether power outages disproportionately affected higher- or lower-income communities.\n\n\nCode\n# Rename the column in income dataset to match with the census tract\nincome_renamed &lt;- income %&gt;% \n  rename(\"GEOID_Data\" = \"GEOID\")\n\n# Left join the two datasets by the geometry\ncensus_income &lt;- census_tract %&gt;% left_join(income_renamed, by = 'GEOID_Data')\n\n\nLet’s verify CRS. Verifying CRS alignment is essential for accurate spatial analysis, as mismatched projections can lead to incorrect geometry intersections, area calculations, or mapping errors.\n\n\nCode\n# Check CRS of the dataset\nif(st_crs(census_income) == st_crs(houston_bbox)){\nprint(\"Coordinate reference systems match!\")\n} else {\nwarning(\"Update coordinate reference systems to match!\")\n}\n\n\nWarning: Update coordinate reference systems to match!\n\n\nBy aligning the coordinate systems and cropping to the Houston study area, census tracts and blackout affected houses are prepared for spatial comparison. Intersections between the two datasets identify which tracts experienced power outages, and a new column flags these impacted areas. Filtering to only the affected tracts enables a targeted analysis and visualization of how the blackout influenced neighborhoods across the city.\n\n\nCode\n# Transform the CRS and crop to houston bounding box\ncensus_income &lt;- st_transform(census_income, crs = 'epsg:4326') \n\n# Crop census income to Houston\ncensus_income_crop &lt;- census_income %&gt;% \n  st_crop(houston_bbox)\n\n\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n\n\nCode\n# Transform and clean blackout houses\nblackout_houses_transformed &lt;- blackout_houses %&gt;% \n  st_transform(crs = 'epsg:4326')\n\n# Identify the blackout areas\ncensus_blackout &lt;- st_intersects(census_income_crop, blackout_houses_transformed)\n\n# Create the column\ncensus_blackout_col &lt;- census_income_crop %&gt;% \n  mutate(blackout = lengths(census_blackout) &gt; 0)\n\n# Select only the values that are true for plotting\ncensus_blackout_col_filtered &lt;- census_blackout_col[census_blackout_col$blackout, ]\n\n\nThe following map highlights Houston census tracts that experienced power outages during the February 2021 winter storms. Affected tracts are shown in red, providing a clear visualization of the spatial distribution of blackouts across the city. This allows for easy identification of neighborhoods impacted by the storm and supports further analysis of socioeconomic patterns in relation to power loss.\n\n\nCode\n# Map the census tracts that lost power\ntm_basemap('CartoDB.VoyagerNoLabels') +\n  tm_shape(census_blackout_col_filtered) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = 'blackout',\n              fill.scale = tm_scale_categorical(\n                values = c('TRUE' = 'firebrick'),\n                labels = c('TRUE' = 'Blackout')),\n              fill.legend = tm_legend(title = 'Blackout status'),\n              col = 'grey50',\n              lwd = 0.2) +\n  tm_title('Census tracts in Houston that lost power',\n           position = tm_pos_out('center', 'top'),\n           fontface = 'bold',\n           size = 1) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,\n            legend.outside.position = 'right',\n            legend.bg.color = 'white',\n            legend.bg.alpha = 0.8) +\n  tm_compass(position = c('right', 'bottom'),\n             type = 'arrow',\n             size = 1) +\n  tm_scalebar(position = c('left', 'top'),\n              text.size = 0.8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot compares the distributions of median household income between Houston census tracts that experienced blackouts and those that did not during the February 2021 winter storms.

Interestingly, higher-income census tracts were more affected, as their median income was slightly higher than that of non-blackout areas. This result may reflect several limitations such as wealthier neighborhoods often have more outdoor lighting, census tract–level data may overlook neighborhood differences, and blackout areas could be misclassified due to highway lighting or cloud cover. The analysis may also have assumed all structures were residential, while vegetation near power lines and the 200-meter buffer used could further limit accuracy of true lighting."

Countries with the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions are typically those with substantial economic resources and intensive industrial activity. Likewise, the nations with the largest GDPs are predominantly highly developed and economically influential. China, United States and India are on both lists, reflecting their positions as large, populous economies with significant global production footprints. However, when we look at the decoupling case, defined as increasing GDP accompanied by declining emissions, only United States was able to achieve decoupling over the past decade, from 2015 to 2024. This explains that it may be challenging for the countries to balance economic growth with meaningful emissions reductions."

    "text": "Interpretation of the Coefficients\nHere, we will interpret the coefficients of our model. The coefficients of the negative binomial regression show that both average GDP growth and average emission reduction have weak relationships with the decoupling year.\nThe intercept coefficient of 1.0423 is statistically significant at p &lt; 0.001 and represents the expected log count of decoupling year when both GDP growth and emission reduction are at zero. This means that when both GDP growth and emission reduction are zero, the expected number of decoupling years is ~ 2.84.\nThe coefficient for average GDP growth is -0.0141, and its p-value (0.0587) shows that this relationship is not strong enough to be considered statistically significant at the 5% level. This negative coefficient suggests that for every one unit increase in average GDP growth, the expected log count of decoupling years decreases by 0.0141, when emission reduction is held constant.\nThe coefficient for average emission reduction is -0.0090, which is marginally significant at p = 0.0523. This indicates that for every one unit increase in emission reduction, the expected log count of decoupling year decreases by 0.0090.\nThis provides evidence for the challenges of achieving decoupling discussed above in the data analysis section. The negative relationship between GDP growth and decoupling years indicates that countries with rapid economic growth may face greater difficulty in sustaining decoupling. This could mean that faster growth increases energy demand and industrial activity that overtakes emission reduction efforts. It could also suggest the presence of confounding variable that need further investigation. Given our observation that only United States achieved true decoupling between 2015 and 2024, these marginal effects align with the overall narrative that balancing economic growth with meaningful emissions reductions remains exceptionally challenging for most countries."

Forest carbon assessments are fundamental part of REDD+, serving as the sole measure to determine whether communities and governments receive performance-based payments.

The project operated under an international climate change framework designed to reward developing countries for ‘Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation’ (REDD+). Forest carbon assessments are fundamental part of REDD+, serving as the sole measure to determine whether communities and governments receive performance-based payments. Yet, despite the scientific precision these carbon inventories require, data can fail in very human ways. What I witnessed was not a theoretical issue discussed in the literature, it was a real case of biased and inconsistent data fabrication that nearly undermined the entire project.\n\n\n\nSource: musimmas.com, How do forests sequester and absorb carbon?"

    "text": "Measuring the forests\nThe conservation project I worked on followed a standard approach: establish a baseline forest carbon stock in Year 1, then conduct a reassessment in Year 3 to track changes. Both assessments relied on systematic sampling across pre-defined plots, measuring variables such as diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, crown cover, species identity, and soil characteristics. Data collection was carried out by trained forest technicians as well as local resource persons with forestry diplomas or undergraduate degrees. These local team members also handled preliminary data entry before the datasets were passed on to the technical team for cleaning and analysis."

    "text": "When data looks too good to be true\nWhen the Year 3 forest carbon stock inventory was done, the estimated carbon sequestration was unexpectedly high, far beyond the ecological trends and management activities observed on the ground. During the data cleaning and quality control process, the technical team found several plots with implausibly high tree diameters and heights, species distributions that did not match the local forest composition, and unrealistic growth rates, a pattern consistent with previous reports of biomass prediction bias in tropical forests (Burt et al., 2020). Further investigation revealed that these entries were traced back to a small number of technicians who had fabricated measurements, likely influenced by the common assumption, even among trained staff, that forest carbon stocks should naturally increase over time.\nThis type of data fabrication falls under human driven data fabrication and falsification bias, which occurs when data collector’s expectations shape the way measurements are recorded. As shown by Zvereva & Kozlov (2021) and Kimmel, Avolio, & Ferraro (2023), observer bias and selective reporting can lead researchers to unintentionally, or sometimes consciously, record or publish data that confirm expected trends. In forest carbon monitoring, even small instances of fabrication can dramatically affect project outcomes, especially in high-stakes frameworks like REDD+."

    "section": "The hidden bias in forest carbon monitoring",
    "text": "The hidden bias in forest carbon monitoring\nBeyond deliberate falsification, the dataset also suffered from multiple metadata and measurement issues, adding further layers of bias.\n\nMeasurement bias: Tree height was recorded using mixed units such as meters and feet, and DBH was not consistently defined as diameter at 1.3 m above the ground, violating basic forest mensuration standards. These inconsistencies made it hard to compare plots accurately and caused the carbon stock estimates to appear more variable than they really were. Such measurement errors are recognized in environmental research as systematic biases that can distort ecological conclusions (Konno et al., 2024).\nMetadata bias: The dataset lacked a standardized datasheet. Species were labeled using local names rather than scientific names, and critical information such as measurement units, sampling dates, and methods was missing. This made it difficult to verify species identities, reproduce analyses, and apply uniform data cleaning procedures. In ecological research, incomplete or inconsistent metadata amplifies uncertainty in biomass estimates and can propagate errors throughout downstream analyses (Burt et al., 2020; Zvereva & Kozlov, 2021).\nProcedural bias: The field teams applied subjective criteria when recording crown cover, tree health, and soil characteristics. The differences in interpretation between teams created inconsistencies across plots, a form of bias recognized in environmental studies where variability in data collection procedures systematically affects outcomes (Konno et al., 2024).\nMisclassified bias: In the Year 3 forest carbon inventory, inconsistent measurement units, unclear DBH definitions, and missing metadata led to biologically implausible values, such as unrealistic height-to-diameter ratios. According to Konno et al. (2024), this represents misclassified comparison bias, which occurs when variables are measured or classified incorrectly. These errors can distort carbon stock estimates, potentially exaggerating sequestration outcomes and affecting REDD+ project decisions.\n\nThese issues reflect broader patterns in biodiversity and forestry research, where inconsistent metadata, unclear measurement protocols, and subjective field judgments lead to significant variability and bias in ecological datasets."

    "text": "Insights from forest carbon monitoring\nThis case made me reflect on the real-world consequences of environmental data bias, not as abstract definitions, but as concrete misrepresentations that shaped forest carbon estimates (Burt et al., 2020; Konno et al., 2024; Zvereva & Kozlov, 2021). It reminded me of a lecture from my Ethics in Environmental Data class, where we learned that bias rarely arises from a single error; it usually emerges from a chain of structural, procedural and human decisions. In this project, technicians operated under the assumption that forest carbon should naturally increase, a mindset that mirrors what our readings classify as confirmation bias. The gaps in metadata and inconsistent measurements align closely with bias categories described in ‘Potential types of bias when estimating causal effects in environmental research and how to interpret them’ (Konno et al., 2024). Misclassified bias, detection bias and performance bias match our scenario of mixed units, unclear DBH definitions, missing species taxonomy, and inconsistent field scoring (Burt et al., 2020; Zvereva & Kozlov, 2021).\nThe impact became clear when questionable height-to-diameter ratios slipped through data cleaning, a clear example of measurement and misclassification bias. Our class discussions emphasized that even minor inconsistencies, like ambiguous units or missing metadata, can cascade through analyses and undermine the validity of inferences. In project like REDD+, poor record keeping and unclear procedures can lead to overestimated carbon stocks, incorrect baseline measurements and flawed decisions regarding policies and funding. This case demonstrates that environmental data is rarely neutral: it is shaped by human assumptions, institutional incentives, and the procedural structures guiding data collection and interpretation. As we discussed in class, these forms of structural bias often go unnoticed because they are embedded in organizational routines rather than individual choices."

    "section": "Solutions for reliable forest carbon monitoring",
    "text": "Solutions for reliable forest carbon monitoring\nThe effective solutions to data bias in forest carbon inventories do more than just improve data integrity, they strengthen the credibility and reliability of the entire monitoring process. Addressing this bias requires interventions at both technical and institutional levels. This includes adopting standardized protocols and metadata standards, defining variables, units, species codes, and implementing quality assurance and quality control workflows to ensure consistency. Such measures make forest monitoring more comparable across regions and time periods, reducing the variability that often undermines ecological assessments. Clear documentation also enables reproducibility, simplifies data cleaning, and strengthens downstream analyses, preventing errors from propagating through carbon stock estimates. Well-structured data practices have become an essential part of how earth and environmental sciences approach data stewardship (Forrester et al., 2016; Candela et al., 2020).\nThe innovative digital tools, such as mobile apps and cloud-based platforms, can further improve data quality by ensuring unit consistency, flagging biologically implausible values and reducing transcription errors (Carroll et al., 2020). Another important strategy is independent verification and random audits. Third parties can check randomly selected plots or datasets to create accountability, detect fabrication and identify procedural biases early on (Burt et al., 2020; Konno et al., 2024).\nFinally, capacity building and ethical training for field staff can help mitigate confirmation and observer biases. The technicians should understand that carbon stocks can increase or decrease, and that uncertainty is an inherent part of forest monitoring. Training in data ethics, handling uncertainty and standardized scoring procedures promotes reliable data collection and discourages intentional or unconscious misreporting (Zvereva & Kozlov, 2021; Vera et al., 2019).\nBy combining technical rigor, digital tools, independent oversight, and inclusive governance, forest carbon inventories can produce accurate and transparent outputs, supporting credible REDD+ accounting, reliable policy decisions and equitable outcomes for communities."

    "text": "About this blog post\nThe Eaton and Palisades fires, which ignited almost simultaneously in early January 2025, showed not only the ecological vulnerability of Los Angeles County’s foothill and coastal wild-land urban interface zones but also the deep social dimensions embedded within wildfire disasters. Using remote sensing tools such as Landsat based false color imagery, environmental monitoring efforts can clearly delineate burn severity, vegetation loss and fire scar patterns that acts as critical information for assessing ecological recovery and guiding restoration. Yet the impacts of these fires extended far beyond the physical landscape. Thousands of homes were destroyed, tens of thousands of residents were displaced, and long standing inequities shaped who suffered most, who could rebuild and how quickly communities could recover. Factors such as income level, housing security, access to insurance, language barriers, transportation availability, and trust in public institutions strongly influenced how individuals responded to evacuation orders, accessed emergency services, and navigated post-fire assistance. By integrating advanced data visualization with an understanding of these social realities, environmental monitoring becomes not only a scientific exercise but also a tool for informing more just, community-centered wildfire resilience planning\nThis analysis combines the environmental monitoring with social vulnerability data to show how the Eaton and Palisades fires affected both the natural landscape and the communities living within it."

There is a only one time coordinate stored as datetime64[ns], that indicates when the image was taken.\nThere are five different spectral bands: red, green, blue, nir08 and swir22, and they have the same pixel grid (float32). A spatial_ref variable is also included to store the map projection information.\n\n\nRestoring geospatial information\n\n\nCode\n# Recover the geospatial information and spatial reference information\nprint(landsat.rio.write_crs(landsat.spatial_ref.crs_wkt, inplace=True))\n\n\n&lt;xarray.Dataset&gt; Size: 78MB\nDimensions:      (y: 1418, x: 2742)\nCoordinates:\n  * y            (y) float64 11kB 3.799e+06 3.799e+06 ... 3.757e+06 3.757e+06\n  * x            (x) float64 22kB 3.344e+05 3.344e+05 ... 4.166e+05 4.166e+05\n    time         datetime64[ns] 8B ...\n    spatial_ref  int64 8B 0\nData variables:\n    red          (y, x) float32 16MB ...\n    green        (y, x) float32 16MB ...\n    blue         (y, x) float32 16MB ...\n    nir08        (y, x) float32 16MB ...\n    swir22       (y, x) float32 16MB ..."

    "text": "Visualize Eaton and Palisades fires\n\nCreate a True color image\nTo create a true-color image from the Landsat dataset, select the red, green, and blue bands, in that order, directly from the existing xarray.Dataset without creating any new variables. Then convert these bands into a NumPy array using the to_array() method and use .plot.imshow() to display them as an RGB image. Two warnings appear during this step, but they are okay to ignore. Finally, adjust the plotting scale, using the robust parameter to handle extreme values, since clouds act as outliers and can compress the contrast of the image if not corrected.\n\n\nCode\n# Select the red, green and blue variables, convert it to a numpy.array and create an RGB image\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\n\n\n/opt/anaconda3/envs/eds220-env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/matplotlib/cm.py:478: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in cast\n  xx = (xx * 255).astype(np.uint8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResolve the other warning, identify which bands have nan values. Here, we  use numpy.isnan().\n\n\nCode\n# Identify 'nan' values in bands\nfor i in ['red', 'green', 'blue']:\n    # .isnull() creates a boolean array (True where NaN)\n    # .sum() sums the True values (counts the NaNs)\n    # .item() converts the single result to a standard Python integer\n    nan_count = landsat[i].isnull().sum().item()\n    print(f\"The {i} band has {nan_count} Nan values.\")\n\n\nThe red band has 0 Nan values.\nThe green band has 1 Nan values.\nThe blue band has 109 Nan values.\n\n\nUse the .fillna() mehtod for xarray.Dataset to substitute the any nan values in the Landsat data for zero.\n\n\nCode\n# Substitute any 'nan' values in the Landsat data for zero\nlandsat = landsat.fillna(0)\n\n\nCreate a new true color image that gets plotted without warnings.\n\n\nCode\n# Create a new true color image without warnings\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA brief explanation comparing the outputs.\nThe first true color image (part a) was plotted directly from the red, green and blue bands without modifying the dataset. The image worked, but we got warnings because some of the data had Nan (missing) values. These missing values caused problems during plotting. Additionally, due to the presence of very bright cloud pixels, many of the other colors appeared darker or washed out, even when using the robust=True to ignore extreme outliers.\nIn part (part e), we replaced all Nan values with zeros before plotting again. This removed the missing values issue allowing the plot to scale the data more smoothly. So, the second true color image displayed without warnings. The second true color image looks cleaner and has better contrast. It doesn’t have the plotting problems seen in the first image.\n\n\nCreate a False color image\nTo create a false-color image, you select the short-wave infrared (swir22), near-infrared and red bands, in that order, directly from the dataset without making any new variables, and then plot them together as an RGB image.\n\n\nCode\n# Create false color image (SWIR2, NIR, Red)\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\nplt.title('False Color Image (SWIR2-NIR-Red)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a False color image for Eaton and Palisades fires\nCreate a map by plotting the shortwave infrared/near-infrared/red false-color image and overlay both fire perimeters on top of it. Customize the map with an informative title and a clear legend, and you may also add text labels directly on the map to identify which fire boundary corresponds to which fire.\n\n\nCode\n# Combine the two fire perimeter datasets into a single GeoDataFrame\nfires = pd.concat([eaton, palisades], ignore_index = True)\n\n# Convert CRS of the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeter to landsat dataset CRS\nfires = fires.to_crs('epsg:32611')\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Initialize the map\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10, 8))\n\n# Plot the false color map\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True,\n                                                           ax = ax,\n                                                           add_colorbar = False)\n\n# Plot fires perimeter on false color map\nfires.boundary.plot(ax = ax, color = 'red', linewidth = 2)\n\n# Add text for first fire (adjust index and name as needed)\nax.text(fires.geometry.centroid.x.values[0] - 11000, fires.geometry.centroid.y.values[0] + 8000, 'Eaton Fire',\n        fontsize = 14, weight = 'bold', color = 'white', ha = 'center', va = 'center')\n\n# Add text for second fire (adjust index and name as needed)\nax.text(fires.geometry.centroid.x.values[-1] - 9000, fires.geometry.centroid.y.values[-1] + 5000, 'Palisades Fire', \n        fontsize = 14, weight = 'bold', color = 'white', ha = 'center', va= 'center')\n\n# Add title to the map\nplt.title('False color image for Eaton and Palisades fire', fontsize = 12, weight = 'bold')\n\n# Remove axes ticks\nax.set_xticks([])  \nax.set_yticks([])  \n\n# Remove axes labels\nax.set_xlabel(\"\")  \nax.set_ylabel(\"\")\n\n# Add a scalebar\n#ax.add_artist(ScaleBar(1, box_color=\"white\",location=\"lower left\"))\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription for the map including a brief explanation of how false color imagery is being used.\nThis map shows a false color image made from Landsat data for Eaton and Palisades fire of the Los Angeles County. The map uses three bands: SWIR2, NIR and Red, assigned to the red, green and blue color channels. In this image, vegetation looks green because they reflect a lot of near-infrared light. The fire burned areas and bare ground looks brown. The urban areas usually appear purple or gray. The water looks black. The boundaries of the Eaton Fire and Palisades fire are delineated with red outlines. Each fire is labeled.\nThis combination of bands is useful for spotting burn scars and understanding fire damage because SWIR2 reacts strongly to moisture changes, and NIR highlights how healthy the vegetation is. Together, these bands make it easy to see where fires have changed the landscape."

    "text": "Analysis 2: Social dimensions of Eaton and Palisades fires\nThe Environmental Justice Index (EJI) highlights the social dimensions of wildfire impacts, revealing how vulnerable communities are disproportionately affected. These maps provide clear visualizations of factors such as age, health, and economic vulnerability, helping to identify populations most at risk and the underlying patterns of environmental injustice in each county.\n\nData analysis sections\n\n\nCode\n# Load census tract-level socioeconomic data\neji = gpd.read_file(\"data/EJI_2024_California/EJI_2024_California.gdb\")\n# Convert CRS of `eji` to match eaton and palisades perimeter data\neji = eji.to_crs(crs = 'epsg:3857')\n\n\nHere, we combine Environmental Justice Index (EJI) data with the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters to analyze the social dimensions of fire impacts. First, a spatial join gpd.sjoin gives all EJI polygons that intersect each fire, keeping full census tracts that are affected. Next, the gpd.clip function trims these polygons to the exact area within the fire boundaries, allowing for precise calculations of vulnerability metrics confined to the burned regions.\n\n\nVisualizations of the social impacts of fires\nThe social dimension of wildfire risk is closely tied to population vulnerability, particularly among elderly residents. In the Environmental Justice Index, the percentage of populations aged 65 and older ‘E_AGE65’ indicate the proportion of seniors within a community relative to others (0–100 scale). This metric matters for wildfire preparedness and response because older adults often face mobility limitations, pre-existing health conditions, and greater reliance on assistance for evacuation. They may also experience longer recovery times following fire events.\n\n\nCode\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 8))\n\n# Update with the eji variable\neji_variable = 'E_AGE65'\n\n# Find common min/max for legend range\nvmin = min(palisades_clip[eji_variable].min(), eaton_clip[eji_variable].min())\nvmax = max(palisades_clip[eji_variable].max(), eaton_clip[eji_variable].max())\n\n# Plot census tracts within Palisades perimeter\npalisades_clip.plot(column= eji_variable, cmap='plasma', vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax, legend=False, ax=ax1, edgecolor='black', linewidth=0.5)\nax1.set_title('Percentage of population aged 65 and above in\\nPalisades Perimeter',\n              fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')\nax1.axis('off')\n\n# Plot census tracts within Eaton perimeter\neaton_clip.plot(column=eji_variable, cmap='plasma', vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax, legend=False, ax=ax2, edgecolor='black', linewidth=0.5)\nax2.set_title('Percentage of population aged 65 and above in\\nEaton Perimeter',\n              fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')\nax2.axis('off')\n\n# Add overall title\nfig.suptitle('Percentage of population aged 65 and above in fire affected areas',\n             fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')\n\n# Add shared colorbar at the bottom\nsm = plt.cm.ScalarMappable(cmap='plasma', norm=plt.Normalize(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax))\ncbar_ax = fig.add_axes([0.25, 0.15, 0.5, 0.04])  # [left, bottom, width, height]\ncbar = fig.colorbar(sm, cax=cbar_ax, orientation='horizontal')\ncbar.set_label('Percentage of population aged 65 and above (0-100)',\n               fontsize=12)\n\nplt.show()"

Interestingly, higher-income census tracts were more affected, as their median income was slightly higher than that of non-blackout areas. This result may reflect several limitations such as wealthier neighborhoods often have more outdoor lighting, census tract–level data may overlook neighborhood differences, and blackout areas could be misclassified due to highway lighting or cloud cover. The analysis may also have assumed all structures were residential, while vegetation near power lines and the 200-meter buffer used could further limit accuracy of true lighting.\nMelaku, Fares, and Awal (2023); Zhou et al.
